Cultivating a company culture no matter how sui generis or mainstream requires
a lot of determination. At Panter unity, transparency and flexibility are core
tenets of our culture. These values are reflected in the [way we work](http://blog.panter.ch/2015/06/12/panter-die-demokratische-firma.html):
lean, entrepreneurial, collaborative. Putting these values into practice requires a lot
of imagination and dedication, but we have found ways to elevate them beyond buzzwords.
## Unity
At Panter we have a [flat hierarchy](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobmorgan/2015/07/13/the-5-types-of-organizational-structures-part-3-flat-organizations/#4650f8ad6caa)
, arguably even a [non-hierarchy](https://hbr.org/2013/11/hierarchy-is-overrated).
Although team members play different roles within our company their ideas,
opinions and contributions are equally valued. This means that our decision making
process is fairly unique, in that all decisions are made together. For a decision to
move forward, it must be unanimously agreed upon. If a unanimous decision was not
reached, the process is paused until it can be revisited and reviewed. The process
owner is then responsible to find a solution that is adjusted according to the objections that were raised.

Decisions with a large impact like new hires, potential projects, and how to progress
on current projects are openly discussed in our weekly, company-wide meeting.
The meeting agenda is an imperative element of this event as all decisions made and
concerns raised are recorded. This provides absent team members with an opportunity
to offer their input on what transpired. Strategic issues that affect the future of
the company, such as our compensation model, are discussed in a group event that
happens 4-6 times a year. This event is important for all employees to attend because
it assures that everyone is involved and aligned in how our company moves forward strategically.

## Transparency
We believe that [transparency](https://blog.panter.ch/2015/11/10/transparenz-als-standard.html)
cultivates trust and is necessary to create a fair, [collaborative](https://www.panter.ch/about/ihz)
work environment. We are continuously seeking ways to help ensure our communication and
processes are as transparent as possible, internally and externally. All of our processes,
decisions and finances are transparent and openly discussed in regular meetings as mentioned above.
The minutes of all meetings, including the Board of Directors’ meetings, are also
saved on shared drives for all employees to access. Our salaries are entirely transparent
within the organisation, not to mention that everyone is compensated based on the same pay scale.
Every month the [salary](https://blog.panter.ch/2016/02/22/das-etwas-andere-lohnmodell.html)
statement of each employee is added to a shared drive that can be accessed by every team member.
The drive also includes a document listing how many hours everyone has worked.

External transparency is how the idea of our [Dashboard](https://dashboard.panter.ch/main)
came to life. The Panter Dashboard is updated daily and offers those outside of
Panter an inside perspective on details such as our average monthly salary and
factor of billable work. We recently devoted an entire
[blogpost](https://blog.panter.ch/2016/07/25/1-jahr-transparenz.html) to it.

## Flexibility
[Flexibility](https://www.panter.ch/job) is one of the most attractive aspects of
working at Panter. Flexibility is really about freedom of choice. At Panter these
choices include holidays, working hours, projects, and preferred equipment.
Being flexible gives each employee an opportunity to help ensure they have a work-life
balance that best suits their lifestyle. Most Panters choose to work around 80% and
often spend the other 20% working on their own projects, interests or family life.
If our life situation changes, it is also possible to adapt our workload accordingly
at anytime. We also have 6 weeks of holiday each year and an additional team building
week abroad spent working on dream projects. The option of unpaid leave or a
sabbatical is also common and welcomed. Being able to choose which projects we prefer
to work on means that we can focus on our particular areas of interest and are
never stuck on a project we dislike.

## Lean
We work according to lean & agile principles. Projects are planned the lean way,
meaning that we start small and test with customers early in the development cycle.
To facilitate this process we use iterative methods like [Scrum](https://www.scrumalliance.org/why-scrum/core-scrum-values-roles?gclid=CLai3_rm59ICFW4z0wod-TMFAg).
Scrum is a development framework that uses cycles called [sprints](http://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/Scrum-sprint),
which at Panter are often just two weeks long. Using sprints versus the non-iterative
[waterfall](http://learnaccessvba.com/application_development/waterfall_method.htm)
method allows us to develop efficiently, quickly adapt to changes according to customer
feedback and easily pivot project goals. In order to make the agile approach work,
we heavily value software quality and automated testing and build self-organized teams
with developers working closely together within sprints to maximize productivity.
Short development cycles are critical when working within a market that evolves
as fast as tech, and necessary to reduce risk for innovation-driven projects.

## Entrepreneurial
Panters like to be on the cutting edge. We keep up with innovative technologies
and processes and apply them in real projects. Practically, this means we prefer
projects that give us an opportunity to explore new technologies and practice
innovative processes. Individually and collectively, we are always learning.
Our yearly offsite Klassenlager is our innovation lab where we bring to life our
entrepreneurial ideas. During one week we work on individual and collective dream projects.

## Collaborative
Making the world a better place for everyone takes innovation and requires collaboration.
We support other entrepreneurs because we believe innovation happens in community not in isolation.
As a [co-founder](https://www.panter.ch/about/ihz) of [Impact Hub Colab](https://zurich.impacthub.ch/de/spaces/colab-location/),
we help build up the startup ecosystem around Panter.
We also actively engage in various offerings of [IHZ](http://www.ihz.ch/home.html) for startups and corporations.
We are as well partners of Kickstart Accelerator an initiative of Digital Switzerland
and Impact Hub Zürich “that provides corporates high speed access to startups.”
To help other companies step up their innovation game, we developed and lead the
[Factories](https://blog.panter.ch/2017/01/17/what-are-factories-and-how-do-they-stimulate-the-lean-approach-to-create-products-services.html),
which help businesses speed up the creation and transformation of their
products and services. We also host a monthly meetup called [Pantalks](http://www.pantalks.ch/) which connects
people who are interested in exchanging knowledge and participating in engaging discussions.

Living our values is certainly challenging at times, but entirely possible to achieve
when we work together. We’d love to know how you tackle similar challenges in your
organization and share experiences. If you’d like to connect please [contact us](https://www.panter.ch/contact).
